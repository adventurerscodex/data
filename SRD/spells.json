The hand doesn't fill its\nspace.\n\nWhen you cast the spell and as a bonus action on\nyour subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to\n60 feet and then cause one of the following effects\nwith it.\n\nClenched Fist. The hand strikes one creature or\nobject within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack\nfor the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the\ntarget takes 4d8 force damage.\n\nForceful Hand. The hand attempts to push a\ncreature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose.\nMake a check with the hand's Strength contested by\nthe Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the\ntarget is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on\nthe check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target\nup to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times\nyour spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves\nwith the target to remain within 5 feet of it.\nGrasping Hand. The hand attempts to grapple a\nHuge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use\nthe hand's Strength score to resolve the grapple. If\nthe target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage\non the check. While the hand is grappling the target,\nyou can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it.\nWhen you do so, the target takes bludgeoning\ndamage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability\nmodifier.\n\nInterposing Hand. The hand interposes itself\nbetween you and a creature you choose until you\ngive the hand a different command. The hand moves\nto stay between you and the target, providing you\nwith half cover against the target. The target can't\nmove through the hand's space if its Strength score\nis less than or equal to the hand's Strength score. If\nits Strength score is higher than the hand's Strength\nscore, the target can move toward you through the\nhand's space, but that space is difficult terrain for the\ntarget.\n\nAt Higher Levels.

The trench extends across\nthe spell's area, and the separated water forms a\nwall to either side. The trench remains until the spell\nends or you choose a different effect. The water then\nslowly fills in the trench over the course of the next\nround until the normal water level is restored.\nRedirect Flow. You cause flowing water in the\narea to move in a direction you choose, even if the\nwater has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in\nother unlikely directions. The water in the area\nmoves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the\nspell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain\nconditions. The water continues to move in the\ndirection you chose until the spell ends or you\nchoose a different effect.\n\nWhirlpool. This effect requires a body of water at\nleast 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a\nwhirlpool to form in the center of the area. The\nwhirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the\nbase, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall.\nAny creature or object in the water and within 25\nfeet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A\ncreature can swim away from the vortex by making a\nStrength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.\nWhen a creature enters the vortex for the first\ntime on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a\nStrength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature\ntakes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the\nvortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the\ncreature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the\nvortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its\naction to try to swim away from the vortex as\ndescribed above, but has disadvantage on the\nStrength (Athletics) check to do so.\n\nThe first time each turn that an object enters the\nvortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage;\nthis damage occurs each round it remains in the\nvortex.\n",

If you probe\ndeeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving\nthrow. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if\nany), its emotional state, and something that looms\nlarge in its mind (such as something it worries over,\nloves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either\nway, the target knows that you are probing into its\nmind, and unless you shift your attention to another\ncreature's thoughts, the creature can use its action\non its turn to make an Intelligence check contested\nby your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell\nends.\n\nQuestions verbally directed at the target creature\nnaturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this\nspell is particularly effective as part of an\ninterrogation.\n\nYou can also use this spell to detect the presence\nof thinking creatures you can't see. When you cast\nthe spell or as your action during the duration, you\ncan search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The\nspell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2\ninches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of\nlead blocks you. You can't detect a creature with an\nIntelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn't speak\nany language.\n\nOnce you detect the presence of a creature in this\nway, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the\nduration as described above, even if you can't see it,\nbut it must still be within range.\n",

On a failed\nsave, the creature's concentration is broken.\nWhen you cast this spell and at the end of each\nturn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on\nthe ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving\nthrow. On a failed save, the creature is knocked\nprone.\n\nThis spell can have additional effects depending\non the terrain in the area, as determined by the GM.\nFissures. Fissures open throughout the spell's\narea at the start of your next turn after you cast the\nspell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations\nchosen by the GM. Each is 1d10 x 10 feet deep, 10\nfeet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell's\narea to the opposite side. A creature standing on a\nspot where a fissure opens must succeed on a\nDexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that\nsuccessfully saves moves with the fissure's edge as it\nopens.\n\nA fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it\nto automatically collapse (see below).\n\nStructures. The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning\ndamage to any structure in contact with the ground\nin the area when you cast the spell and at the start of\neach of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure\ndrops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially\ndamages nearby creatures. A creature within half the\ndistance of a structure's height must make a\nDexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature\ntakes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone,\nand is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20\nStrength (Athletics) check as an action to escape.\nThe GM can adjust the DC higher or lower,\ndepending on the nature of the rubble. On a\nsuccessful save, the creature takes half as much\ndamage and doesn't fall prone or become buried.\n",

Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you,\nand it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when\nyou cast it.

For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most\ntypical triggers include touching or standing on the\nglyph, removing another object covering the glyph,\napproaching within a certain distance of the glyph,\nor manipulating the object on which the glyph is\ninscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the\nmost common triggers include opening that object,\napproaching within a certain distance of the object,\nor seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is\ntriggered, this spell ends.\n\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell\nactivates only under certain circumstances or\naccording to physical characteristics (such as height\nor weight), creature kind (for example, the ward\ncould be set to affect aberrations or drow), or\nalignment. You can also set conditions for creatures\nthat don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a\ncertain password.\n\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive\nrunes or a spell glyph.\n\nExplosive Runes. When triggered, the glyph\nerupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius\nsphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads\naround corners. Each creature in the area must\nmake a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8\nacid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a\nfailed saving throw (your choice when you create\nthe glyph), or half as much damage on a successful\none.\n\nSpell Glyph. You can store a prepared spell of 3rd\nlevel or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of\ncreating the glyph. The spell must target a single\ncreature or an area. The spell being stored has no\nimmediate effect when cast in this way. When the\nglyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell\nhas a target, it targets the creature that triggered the\nglyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered\non that creature. If the spell summons hostile\ncreatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they\nappear as close as possible to the intruder and attack\nit. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the\nend of its full duration.\n\nAt Higher Levels.

The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall,\nand shaped as you desire. You can ward several\nstories of a stronghold by dividing the area among\nthem, as long as you can walk into each contiguous\narea while you are casting the spell.\n\nWhen you cast this spell, you can specify\nindividuals that are unaffected by any or all of the\neffects that you choose. You can also specify a\npassword that, when spoken aloud, makes the\nspeaker immune to these effects.\n\nGuards and wards creates the following effects\nwithin the warded area.\n\nCorridors. Fog fills all the warded corridors,\nmaking them heavily obscured. In addition, at each\nintersection or branching passage offering a choice\nof direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a\ncreature other than you will believe it is going in the\nopposite direction from the one it chooses.\n\nDoors. All doors in the warded area are magically\nlocked, as if sealed by an arcane lock spell. In\naddition, you can cover up to ten doors with an\nillusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of\nthe minor illusion spell) to make them appear as\nplain sections of wall.\n\nStairs. Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from\ntop to bottom, as the web spell. These strands\nregrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn\naway while guards and wards lasts.\nOther Spell Effect. You can place your choice of\none of the following magical effects within the\nwarded area of the stronghold.\n\n* Place dancing lights in four corridors. You can\ndesignate a simple program that the lights repeat\nas long as guards and wards lasts.\n* Place magic mouth in two locations.\n* Place stinking cloud in two locations. The vapors\nappear in the places you designate; they return\nwithin 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while\nguards and wards lasts.\n* Place a constant gust of wind in one corridor or\nroom.\n* Place a suggestion in one location. You select an\narea of up to 5 feet square, and any creature that\nenters or passes through the area receives the\nsuggestion mentally.\n\nThe whole warded area radiates magic. A dispel\nmagic cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes\nonly that effect.\n\nYou can create a permanently guarded and\nwarded structure by casting this spell there every\nday for one year.\n",

The target is\nrestrained until the spell ends, and it can't move or\nbe moved by any means until then.\nThe special component for this version of the spell\nis a fine chain of precious metal.\nHedged Prison. The spell transports the target\ninto a tiny demiplane that is warded against\nteleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can\nbe a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar\nconfined structure or area of your choice.\nThe special component for this version of the spell\nis a miniature representation of the prison made\nfrom jade.\n\nMinimus Containment. The target shrinks to a\nheight of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone\nor similar object. Light can pass through the\ngemstone normally (allowing the target to see out\nand other creatures to see in), but nothing else can\npass through, even by means of teleportation or\nplanar travel. The gemstone can't be cut or broken\nwhile the spell remains in effect.\nThe special component for this version of the spell\nis a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum,\ndiamond, or ruby.\n\nSlumber. The target falls asleep and can't be\nawoken. The special component for this version of\nthe spell consists of rare soporific herbs.\nEnding the Spell. During the casting of the spell, in\nany of its versions, you can specify a condition that\nwill cause the spell to end and release the target. The\ncondition can be as specific or as elaborate as you\nchoose, but the GM must agree that the condition is\nreasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass.\nThe conditions can be based on a creature's name,\nidentity, or deity but otherwise must be based on\nobservable actions or qualities and not based on\nintangibles such as level, class, or hit points.\n\nA dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is\ncast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison\nor the special component used to create it.\n\nYou can use a particular special component to\ncreate only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell\nagain using the same component, the target of the\nfirst casting is immediately freed from its binding.\n",

Some\ncreatures might exchange their service for a quest\nundertaken by you.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in\nminutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per\nminute.

If it fails that save, the creature is\ntransported to another plane of the GM's choosing\nand is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that\nis on a plane that isn't its home plane is banished\nhome, while other creatures are usually cast into the\nAstral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by\na dispel magic spell or a similar spell of equal or\nhigher level that can end spells and magical effects.\n",

If you choose a surface, the\nglyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than\n10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that\nobject must remain in its place; if the object is\nmoved more than 10 feet from where you cast this\nspell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without\nbeing triggered.\n\nThe glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an\nIntelligence (Investigation) check against your spell\nsave DC to find it.\n\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast\nthe spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most\ntypical triggers include touching or stepping on the\nglyph, removing another object covering it,\napproaching within a certain distance of it, or\nmanipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs\ninscribed within an object, the most common\ntriggers are opening the object, approaching within a\ncertain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell is\nactivated only under certain circumstances or\naccording to a creature's physical characteristics\n(such as height or weight), or physical kind (for\nexample, the ward could be set to affect hags or\nshapechangers). You can also specify creatures that\ndon't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a\ncertain password.\n\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the\noptions below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph\nglows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light\nfor 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each\ncreature in the sphere when the glyph activates is\ntargeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the\nsphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn\nthere.\n\nDeath. Each target must make a Constitution\nsaving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a\nfailed save, or half as much damage on a successful\nsave.\n\nDiscord. Each target must make a Constitution\nsaving throw. On a failed save, a target bickers and\nargues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this\ntime, it is incapable of meaningful communication\nand has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability\nchecks.\n\nFear. Each target must make a Wisdom saving\nthrow and becomes frightened for 1 minute on a\nfailed save. While frightened, the target drops\nwhatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet\naway from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.\nHopelessness. Each target must make a Charisma\nsaving throw. On a failed save, the target is\noverwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this\ntime, it can't attack or target any creature with\nharmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects.\nInsanity. Each target must make an Intelligence\nsaving throw. On a failed save, the target is driven\ninsane for 1 minute. An insane creature can't take\nactions, can't understand what other creatures say,\ncan't read, and speaks only in gibberish. The GM\ncontrols its movement, which is erratic.\nPain. Each target must make a Constitution saving\nthrow and becomes incapacitated with excruciating\npain for 1 minute on a failed save.\n\nSleep. Each target must make a Wisdom saving\nthrow and falls unconscious for 10 minutes on a\nfailed save. A creature awakens if it takes damage or\nif someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.\nStunning.

You and your group (or the target\nobject) appear where you want to.\n\nOff Target. You and your group (or the target\nobject) appear a random distance away from the\ndestination in a random direction. Distance off target\nis 1d10 x 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be\ntraveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120\nmiles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the\ntwo d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent,\nor 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off\ntarget randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as\nnorth, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the\npoints of the compass. If you were teleporting to a\ncoastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you\ncould be in trouble.\n\nSimilar Area. You and your group (or the target\nobject) wind up in a different area that's visually or\nthematically similar to the target area. If you are\nheading for your home laboratory, for example, you\nmight wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in\nan alchemical supply shop that has many of the same\ntools and implements as your laboratory. Generally,\nyou appear in the closest similar place, but since the\nspell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind\nup anywhere on the plane.\n\nMishap. The spell's unpredictable magic results in\na difficult journey.

You don't need to meet\nany requirements in that spell, including costly\ncomponents. The spell simply takes effect.\nAlternatively, you can create one of the following\neffects of your choice:\n\n* You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value\nthat isn't a magic item. The object can be no more\nthan 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in\nan unoccupied space you can see on the ground.\n* You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see\nto regain all hit points, and you end all effects on\nthem described in the greater restoration spell.\n* You grant up to ten creatures that you can see\nresistance to a damage type you choose.\n* You grant up to ten creatures you can see\nimmunity to a single spell or other magical effect\nfor 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself\nand all your companions immune to a lich's life\ndrain attack.\n\n* You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll\nof any roll made within the last round (including\nyour last turn). Reality reshapes itself to\naccommodate the new result. For example, a wish\nspell could undo an opponent's successful save, a\nfoe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can\nforce the reroll to be made with advantage or\ndisadvantage, and you can choose whether to use\nthe reroll or the original roll.\n\nYou might be able to achieve something beyond the\nscope of the above examples. State your wish to the\nGM as precisely as possible. The GM has great\nlatitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance;\nthe greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that\nsomething goes wrong. This spell might simply fail,\nthe effect you desire might only be partly achieved,\nor you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as\na result of how you worded the wish. For example,\nwishing that a villain were dead might propel you\nforward in time to a period when that villain is no\nlonger alive, effectively removing you from the game.\nSimilarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or\nartifact might instantly transport you to the\npresence of the item's current owner.\n\nThe stress of casting this spell to produce any\neffect other than duplicating another spell weakens\nyou. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a\nspell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10\nnecrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage\ncan't be reduced or prevented in any way. In\naddition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or\nlower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days\nthat you spend resting and doing nothing more than\nlight activity, your remaining recovery time\ndecreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent\nchance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if\nyou suffer this stress.\n",
