You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.\n\nSpells Known of 1st Level and Higher\n\nYou know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.\n\nThe Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.\n\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\nSpellcasting Ability\n\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\n\nRitual Casting\n\nYou can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.\n\nSpellcasting Focus\n\nYou can use a musical instrument (see \u201cEquipment\u201d) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.\n",

You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.\n\nPreparing and Casting Spells\n\nThe Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.\n\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\n\nSpellcasting Ability\n\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\n\nRitual Casting\n\nYou can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.\n\nSpellcasting Focus\n\nYou can use a holy symbol (see \u201cEquipment\u201d) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.\n",

You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.\n\nPreparing and Casting Spells\n\nThe Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nYou prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.\n\nYou can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\n\nSpellcasting Ability\n\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\n\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\n\nRitual Casting\n\nYou can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.\n\nSpellcasting Focus\n\nYou can use a druidic focus (see \u201cEquipment\u201d) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.\n",

You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\n\nYour druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table.\n\nAt 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.\n\n<table class=\"table table-responsive table-ac-bordered table-hover\"><thead> <caption>Beast Shapes</caption> <tr> <td>Level</td> <td>Max.

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. While you are transformed, the following rules apply:\n\n* Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.\n\n* When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.\n\n* You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.\n\n* You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.\n\n* You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.\n",

To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nYou prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\nFor example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2ndlevel slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.\n\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\n\nSpellcasting Ability\n\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\n\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\n\nSpellcasting Focus\n\nYou can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.\n",

You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.\n\nSpell Slots\n\nThe Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.\n\nFor example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell thunderwave, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.\n\nSpells Known of 1st Level and Higher\n\nAt 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list. The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.\n\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\nSpellcasting Ability\n\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\n\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\n\nSpellcasting Focus\n\nYou can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.\n",

Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class's spell list (the two needn't be from the same list). The spells appear in the book and don't count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can't cast the spells except as rituals, unless you've learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.\n\nOn your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell's level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.\n",

You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.\n\nSpellbook\n\nAt 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1stlevel wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.\n\nPreparing and Casting Spells\n\nThe Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nYou prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\nFor example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.\n\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\n\nSpellcasting Ability\n\nIntelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\n\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\n\nRitual Casting\n\nYou can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.\n\nSpellcasting Focus\n\nYou can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.\n\nLearning Spells of 1st Level and Higher\n\nEach time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table.\n\nOn your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the \u201cYour Spellbook\u201d sidebar).\n",
